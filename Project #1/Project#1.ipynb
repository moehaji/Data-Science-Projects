The documenation for their descriptions can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home). The column names I found interesting from the Google Play Store include \"App\", \"Category\", \"Rating\", \"Reviews\", \"Installs\", \"Price\" and \"Genres\". The documentation for their descriptions can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home). The reasion I found these categories interesting is because we can understand the user's like and dislikes with the user ratings/Reviews categories, how much a user may be willing to pay or if they prefer free apps with the price/Price categories, or what genres the user may typically enjoy with prime_genre/Genre categories.
